For some reason, when building OIS as a static lib, the dxguid.lib and dinput8.lib libraries are not included in the additional dependencies in the generated projects, even though they are listed in the CMake scripts.
Because of this, after generating the projects, before building the lib. Make sure the two above libraries are included in Librarian -> General for all configurations, in Visual Studio.
